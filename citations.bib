	abstract = {Continuous monitoring of physiological parameters is very often necessary for the evaluation of health conditions, diagnostic reasons and the detection of life or health threatening events. For infants, especially, who cannot provide any feedback about discomfort or health complaints it is an important issue to collect objective data under everyday conditions. The demand of physicians for the development of monitoring and diagnostic systems which are easier to handle and less obtrusive than the commonly used medical systems was the motivation for the presented project. Another motivation was the concern frequently expressed by parents about the danger of apparently life threatening events (ALTE) or even the problems of sudden infants death syndrome (SIDS). The developed sensory baby vest includes fully integrated sensors for the parameters respiration, heart rate, temperature and humidity, to detect excessive sweating, for the continuous monitoring of infants under clinical and home conditions. It will allow the early detection of potential life threatening events calling for rescue as well as the recognition of the development or progression of diseases at an early stage. Health protection or even life-saving thus will be enabled in time. A variety of principles for the measurement of the parameters has been assessed for the integration into garments. Prototypes have been manufactured incorporating the chosen sensing principles with textile and textile-compatible technologies. Currently, the prototypes are clinically tested for durability, handling and signal quality.},

	abstract = {Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is one of the major causes of death among infants during their sleep. To increase the safety of the infants, we matched different emergent research fields for the development of Baby Night Watch. This Smart Wearable System (SWS), developed under the context of the European Texas Instruments Innovation Challenge (TIIC) 2015, is composed by the following elements: a Wearable IoT Device, a Gateway and the H Medical Interface. The Wearable IoT Device is a wireless sensor node integrated in a Chest Belt, and it has the capacity to monitor the following parameters: body temperature, heart and breathing rates and body position. After a minimal data processing, this set of information is sent to the Gateway, via ZigBee technology, and it is accessible to the user through the H Medical Interface. If a critical event occurs, the device will trigger an alarm, visible and audible in the proximity, and sends a distress message to a mobile application. The Baby Night Watch is an important tool for medical studies, since it allows the visualization of previous physiological data and export it to different types of datasets. Experimental tests have proven that the SWS has the potential to identify situations that could be potentially life-threatening for an infant.},

	doi = {10.1109/DICTA.2015.7371224},
	abstract = {Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the major cause of death for infants aged one week to twelve months. The SIDS rate has declined owing to the awareness of caregivers and parents, but the rate is still high even in developed countries because of the difficulty in rescuing the infant immediately. Respiration, which can reflect various physiological conditions, is a basic but vital function for infants. Therefore, this study presents a respiration monitoring system with a video camera positioned in front of an infant to non-invasively detect the infant's respiratory frequency. The proposed system can continuously monitor the infant to detect unusual occurrences in the infant's respiration, to alert caregivers to attend to the infant immediately and reduce potential injuries from SIDS and other respiratory-related disease. The proposed system contains four major stages, including motion detection, candidate point extraction, respiration point selection, and respiratory frequency calculation. During motion detection the system captures images from video and decides whether to conduct the following stages. If no obvious motion is detected in the input frames, then SIDS may have occurred in the infant, and the system extracts candidate points by some spatial characteristics. Based on these points, the system then selects respiration points using a fuzzy integral technique with four temporal characteristics, including entropy, period, skewness, and kurtosis. Finally, the infant's respiratory frequency is calculated. Experimental data are obtained from ten infants, in 48 sequences with a total length of 150 minutes. The experimental results show that the proposed system is robust and efficient.},

	abstract = {Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, also known as SIDS, is the leading cause of mortality in infants from one month to one year of age. We propose a video-based baby monitoring system with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities to help shorten the response time of SIDS cases. Using a video amplification technique developed at MIT dubbed “Eulerian Magnification” to amplify subtle movements, we can compare pixel color differences in frames for breathing detection in a recorded video of a baby. When abnormal movement is detected from the baby, an alarm will be generated to notify the parents or guardians. The expected accuracy is over 98\% for a baby monitor that is intended to be a noninvasive, low cost and efficient solution. The major monitoring situation we considered is during night time, therefore we used a night vision camera for the tests. The camera frame was focused in the size of a crib, and hence there is no concern about losing the sight of the infant which would cause monitoring failure. Currently our team has accomplished the algorithm design and alarm generating design. We consider that making it works in real-time and on an independent IoT board are the future work to complete this project.},

Furthermore, we extend and adapt the recently developed models that capture data-dependent uncertainty from noisy observations for our application. The experimental results show significant improvements on YunInfants dataset across most of the tasks over the models that simply adopt the regular cross-entropy losses without addressing the effect of the underlying uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) causes infants under one year of age to die inexplicably. One of the most important external factors, also called an "outside stressor," that is responsible for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), is the sleeping position of the baby. According to past research, the risk of SIDS increases when the baby sleeps facedown on the stomach. We propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based computer-vision system that estimates the sleeping pose of the baby and alerts caregivers on their mobile phones within a few seconds of the baby moving to the hazardous facedown sleeping position. The system has a low computational load and a low memory footprint. This characteristic allows the system to be embedded in low power edge devices such as certain baby monitors. Processing at the edge also alleviates privacy concerns with regards to sending images into the network. We experimented with various numbers of convolutional processing units and dense layers as well as the number of convolutional kernels to arrive at the optimal production configuration. We observed a consistently high accuracy of detection of infant sleeping position changes from turning to facedown positions with a potential towards even higher accuracies with caregiver feedback for model retraining. Therefore, this system is a viable candidate for consideration as a non-intrusive solution to assist in preventing SIDS.},

	abstract = {Though tremendous strides have been made in uncontrolled face detection, accurate and efficient 2D face alignment and 3D face reconstruction in-the-wild remain an open challenge. In this paper, we present a novel single-shot, multi-level face localisation method, named RetinaFace, which unifies face box prediction, 2D facial landmark localisation and 3D vertices regression under one common target: point regression on the image plane. To fill the data gap, we manually annotated five facial landmarks on the WIDER FACE dataset and employed a semi-automatic annotation pipeline to generate 3D vertices for face images from the WIDER FACE, AFLW and FDDB datasets. Based on extra annotations, we propose a mutually beneficial regression target for 3D face reconstruction, that is predicting 3D vertices projected on the image plane constrained by a common 3D topology. The proposed 3D face reconstruction branch can be easily incorporated, without any optimisation difficulty, in parallel with the existing box and 2D landmark regression branches during joint training. Extensive experimental results show that RetinaFace can simultaneously achieve stable face detection, accurate 2D face alignment and robust 3D face reconstruction while being efficient through single-shot inference.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

Due to the limited computing resource in such scenarios, it is usually difficult to meet the need of both accuracy and speed. Most detectors cannot detect small face accurately or the detection speed will slow down. To address this challenge, we propose a novel face detector in which the basic framework is a single shot multibox detector (SSD), and name it Face SSD. In order to accelerate the detection speed of Face SSD and improve the detection accuracy, we make contributions in the following three aspects: we improved the structure of ShuffleNet V2 and use it as the backbone network; then we proposed a modified prediction module (MPM) to improve recall of small faces; finally we introduced a scale-equitable face detection framework to match face better. Experimental results show that Face SSD runs 40 frames per second (FPS) on CPU and 110 FPS on GPU. We train Face SSD on WIDER FACE - a face detection benchmark. The detector has also achieved excellent performance on FDDB, a benchmark for face detection in unconstrained settings.},

This paper introduced the process of building skin color model based on ellipse clustering and detection to image with this skin color model. Before the skin color model building, we analysed color space and chose lighten-unrelated YCbCr space. Because of the effect of environment when get the image, we compensated illumination with logarithm transformation and filter the right light based on statistic. Also, in order to improve the detecting efficiency, we import an ponderance named Ct to present the number of skin pixels. If Ct lower than a threshold, we look it as non-skin pixels. The experiment proved that this skin color model can detect the skin pixels more effectively and have high robust. Compared to the traditional skin color model such as regional model, single gauss model etc, the algorithmical complexity, detecting rate and error detect rate have evident improvement.},

	abstract = {To investigate the recurrence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) among siblings, the authors analyzed data for all 352,475 mothers whose first and second single births were reported to the Medical Birth Registry of Norway during 1967-1988. Recurrence of stillbirths from the 16th week of gestation onward and infant deaths other than SIDS were also studied. Relative risk of recurrence for SIDS was 5.8 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-13.2); for asphyxia- and immaturity-related infant deaths, 12.5 (9.2-17.4); for congenital malformations, 7.2 (4.7-11.0); and for other causes of infant death, 8.0 (2.0-22.1). Deaths due to infections did not recur. Similar categories of infant deaths had higher overall relative risk, 9.1, compared with 1.6 for dissimilar categories. Previous early stillbirth (16-27 weeks) had a high recurrence (relative risk (RR) = 21.8, 95\% CI 17.5-26.9), while late stillbirth ({\textgreater} or = 28 weeks) had lower recurrence (RR = 4.6, 95\% CI 3.7-5.8). Previous SIDS was associated with an increased risk of all other types of loss. In contrast, previous late stillbirth and previous asphyxia- and immaturity-related infant deaths were associated with a reduced risk of subsequent SIDS (RR = 0.31, 95\% CI 0.08-0.84, and RR = 0.23, 95\% CI 0.01-1.13, respectively). In conclusion, as with other infant and fetal deaths, SIDS deaths showed strong sibship aggregation consistent with a genetic susceptibility in subsets of SIDS that may interact with environmental factors. The authors also suggest common pregnancy-specific risk factors for late stillbirths, asphyxia- and immaturity-related infant deaths, and SIDS.},

METHODS: We analyzed data from a population-based case-control study of 260 SIDS deaths that occurred in Chicago between 1993 and 1996 and an equal number of matched living controls to determine the association between SIDS and factors in the sleep environment and other variables related to infant care.
RESULTS: The racial/ethnic composition of the study groups was 75.0\% black; 13.1\% Hispanic white; and 11.9\% non-Hispanic white. Several factors related to the sleep environment during last sleep were associated with higher risk of SIDS: placement in the prone position (unadjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2.4; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7-3.4), soft surface (OR: 5.1; 95\% CI: 3.1-8.3), pillow use (OR: 2.5; 95\% CI: 1.5-4.2), face and/or head covered with bedding (OR: 2.5; 95\% CI: 1.3-4.6), bed sharing overall (OR: 2.7; 95\% CI: 1.8-4.2), bed sharing with parent(s) alone (OR: 1.9; 95\% CI: 1.2-3.1), and bed sharing in other combinations (OR: 5.4; 95\% CI: 2.8-10.2). Pacifier use was associated with decreased risk (unadjusted OR: 0.3; 95\% CI: 0.2-0.5), as was breastfeeding either ever (OR: 0.2; 95\% CI: 0.1-0.3) or currently (OR: 0.2; 95\% CI: 0.1-0.4). In a multivariate model, several factors remained significant: prone sleep position, soft surface, pillow use, bed sharing other than with parent(s) alone, and not using a pacifier.
CONCLUSIONS: To lower further the SIDS rate among black and other racial/ethnic groups, prone sleeping, the use of soft bedding and pillows, and some types of bed sharing should be reduced.},

METHODS: Data from international vital statistics, epidemiologic studies of SIDS risk factors, and studies of outcomes of public health interventions that advocated nonprone sleeping to reduce the risk for SIDS were discussed at a meeting held by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) with cosponsorship from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) on January 13, and 14, 1994.
RESULTS: Trends in postneonatal mortality and SIDS rates from 1980 through 1992 were evaluated for Australia, Britain, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United States. All of the countries that experienced a rapid decline in prone sleeping also had reductions of approximately 50\% in their SIDS rates. Postneonatal mortality rates dropped as well, with the reduction in SIDS being the primary contributor to the reported declines. The major behavioral change in all targeted populations was in sleep position. No significant changes were observed in the proportion of parents who smoked cigarettes, or in breast-feeding. Preliminary data from population-based studies showed there were no reported adverse outcomes associated with a change to side or back sleep position, such as an increase in deaths due to aspiration or in apparent life-threatening events.
CONCLUSION: The overwhelming opinion of the assembled experts was that the evidence justified greater effort to reach parents with the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendation that healthy infants, when being put down to sleep, be positioned on their side or back.},

Within New Zealand the rate is higher in Maori than in non-Maori (predominantly European infants) and higher in South Island than in North Island. The National Cot Death Prevention Programme aims to reduce the prevalence of four modifiable risk factors for SIDS, namely infants sleeping prone, maternal smoking, lack of breast feeding, and infants sharing a bed with another person. The aim of this study is to describe the total postneonatal and total SIDS mortality in New Zealand from 1986 to 1992. Official publications from 1986 to 1990 and preliminary death notifications for 1991 and 1992 were examined. Deaths from all causes in the postneonatal age group (28 days to 1 year) and the total number of deaths from SIDS irrespective of age decreased markedly in 1990 and has continued to decrease. This decrease occurred particularly in non-Maori groups, in South Island, and in the winter months. The proportion of infants sleeping in a prone position has decreased from 43\% to less than 5\%. This suggests that the prone position is causally related to SIDS. The mechanism appears to be related directly or indirectly to environmental temperature.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a leading cause of postneonatal mortality among American Indians, a group whose infant death rate is consistently above the US national average.
OBJECTIVE: To determine prenatal and postnatal risk factors for SIDS among American Indians.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based case-control study of 33 SIDS infants and 66 matched living controls among American Indians in South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, and Iowa enrolled from December 1992 to November 1996 and investigated using standardized parental interview, medical record abstraction, autopsy protocol, and infant death review.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Association of SIDS with maternal socioeconomic and behavioral factors, health care utilization, and infant care practices.
RESULTS: The proportions of case and control infants who were usually placed prone to sleep (15.2\% and 13.6\%, respectively), who shared a bed with parents (59.4\% and 55.4\%), or whose mothers smoked during pregnancy (69.7\% and 54.6\%) were similar. However, mothers of 72.7\% of case infants and 45.5\% of control infants engaged in binge drinking during pregnancy. Conditional logistic regression revealed significant associations between SIDS and 2 or more layers of clothing on the infant (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.2; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-26.5), any visits by a public health nurse (aOR, 0.2; 95\% CI, 0.1-0.8), periconceptional maternal alcohol use (aOR, 6.2; 95\% CI, 1.6-23.3), and maternal first-trimester binge drinking (aOR, 8.2; 95\% CI, 1.9-35.3).
CONCLUSIONS: Public health nurse visits, maternal alcohol use during the periconceptional period and first trimester, and layers of clothing are important risk factors for SIDS among Northern Plains Indians. Strengthening public health nurse visiting programs and programs to reduce alcohol consumption among women of childbearing age could potentially reduce the high rate of SIDS.},

	doi = {10.1542/peds.106.3.e41},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prone sleep and unsafe sleep surfaces increase the risk of sudden infant death. Recent epidemiologic studies also suggest that when an infant's head or face is covered by bedding, or when a sleep surface is shared with others, the risk of dying increases. The inference of a causal role for these risk factors is supported by physiologic studies and by the consistent finding that fewer infants die when risk factors are reduced. The prevalence of most of these risk factors in infant deaths in the United States is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of several important risk factors related to sleep practices among a defined population of infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly.
METHODS: In this population-based study, we retrospectively reviewed death-scene information and medical examiners' investigations of deaths in the city of St Louis and St Louis County between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 1997. Because of the potential for diagnostic overlap, all deaths involving infants {\textless}2 years old with the diagnoses of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), accidental suffocation, or cause undetermined were included.
RESULTS: The deaths of 119 infants were studied. Their mean age was 109.3 days (range: 6-350). The diagnoses were SIDS in 88 deaths, accidental suffocation in 16, and undetermined in 15. Infants were found prone in 61.1\% of cases and were found on a sleep surface not designed for infants in 75.9\%. The head or face was covered by bedding in 29.4\%. A shared sleep surface was the site of death in 47.1\%. Only 8.4\% of deaths involved infants found nonprone and alone, with head and face uncovered.
CONCLUSIONS: Using detailed death-scene descriptions, we found that similar unsafe sleeping practices occurred in the large majority of cases diagnosed as SIDS, accidental suffocation, and cause undetermined. Considering these diagnoses together may be useful in public health campaigns during a time when there may be diagnostic overlap. Regardless of the diagnosis, recommendations that infants sleep supine on firm sleep surfaces that lessen the risk of entrapment or head covering have the potential to save many lives. Campaigns are needed to heighten awareness of these messages and of the risks of dangerous bedsharing.},

METHODS: We analyzed data from a case-control study (58 infants with SIDS and 120 control infants) and a prospective cohort study (22 infants with SIDS and 213 control infants) in Tasmania. Interactions were examined in matched analyses with a multiplicative model of interaction.
RESULTS: In the case-control study, SIDS was significantly associated with sleeping in the prone position, as compared with other positions (unadjusted odds ratio, 4.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 9.6). The strength of this association was increased among infants who slept on natural-fiber mattresses (P = 0.05), infants who were swaddled (P = 0.09), infants who slept in heated rooms (P = 0.006), and infants who had had a recent illness (P = 0.02). These variables had no significant effect on infants who did not sleep in the prone position. A history of recent illness was significantly associated with SIDS among infants who slept prone (odds ratio, 5.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 19) but not among infants who slept in other positions (odds ratio, 0.83). In the cohort study, the risk of SIDS was greater among infants who slept prone on natural-fiber mattresses (odds ratio, 6.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 33) than among infants who slept prone on other types of mattresses (odds ratio, 1.8).
CONCLUSIONS: When infants sleep prone, the elevated risk of SIDS is increased by each of four factors: the use of natural-fiber mattresses, swaddling, recent illness, and the use of heating in bedrooms.},

We assessed this assumption in an investigation of infant deaths that occurred during sleep on cushions filled with polystyrene beads.
METHODS: We obtained data on 25 deaths from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. We also used mechanical and animal models to study physiologic aspects of ventilation relevant to these results, by simulating the effects on an infant of breathing into a cushion. We measured the effects of softness, malleability (molding of the cushion about an infant's head), airflow resistance, and rebreathing of expired gases.
RESULTS: All 25 study infants were prone when found dead, and at least 88 percent were face down with nose and mouth obstructed by the cushion. SIDS was the diagnosis in 19 of the 23 infants who underwent autopsy. Our findings show, however, that the cushion would have limited movement of the infant's head to obtain fresh air, and the amount of rebreathing we estimated to have occurred in the infants was lethal in a rabbit model.
CONCLUSIONS: Accidental suffocation by rebreathing was the most likely cause of death in most of the 25 infants studied. Consequently, there is a need to reassess the cause of death in the 28 to 52 percent of the victims of SIDS who are found with their faces straight down. Safety regulations setting standards for softness, malleability, and the potential for rebreathing are needed for infant bedding.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the consequences of getting the head covered by bedding (fiber quilt) on carbon dioxide (CO2) accumulation around the face, behavior, and physiologic responses during prone and supine sleep in infants to add understanding to why victims of sudden infant death syndrome are often found under the bedding. METHPDOLOGY: Of 33 healthy term, usually nonprone sleeping infants, behavior and computerized polysomnography were successfully recorded for 30 during prone and supine sleep at 21/2 months and for 23 prone and 25 supine at 5 months.
RESULTS: For both ages and body positions, covering the head resulted in significant CO2 accumulation around the face, fewer apneas (3 to 10 seconds), shorter duration of apneas after sighs, higher heart and respiratory rates, and peripheral skin temperature. Differences were generally greater at 21/2 than at 5 months. While covered, the prone position was associated with higher CO2 levels close to the face, slightly higher transcutaneous PCO2, and higher heart rates and peripheral skin temperatures than the supine position. In the supine position 23\% were able to remove the cover from the head at 21/2 and 60\% at 5 months, whereas only 1 infant of 5 months managed to remove the cover when prone.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed responses are consistent with a potential for distress when the head is covered, particularly when placed prone. Probably most important with respect to sudden infant death syndrome is the infants' inability to remove the bedding from the head upon awakening from prone sleep.},

	abstract = {Despite a major decrease in the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) since the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released its recommendation in 1992 that infants be placed for sleep in a nonprone position, this decline has plateaued in recent years. Concurrently, other causes of sudden unexpected infant death occurring during sleep (sleep-related deaths), including suffocation, asphyxia, and entrapment, and ill-defined or unspecified causes of death have increased in incidence, particularly since the AAP published its last statement on SIDS in 2005. It has become increasingly important to address these other causes of sleep-related infant death. Many of the modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors for SIDS and suffocation are strikingly similar. The AAP, therefore, is expanding its recommendations from being only SIDS-focused to focusing on a safe sleep environment that can reduce the risk of all sleep-related infant deaths including SIDS. The recommendations described in this report include supine positioning, use of a firm sleep surface, breastfeeding, room-sharing without bed-sharing, routine immunization, consideration of a pacifier, and avoidance of soft bedding, overheating, and exposure to tobacco smoke, alcohol, and illicit drugs. The rationale for these recommendations is discussed in detail in this technical report. The recommendations are published in the accompanying “Policy Statement—Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and Other Sleep-Related Infant Deaths: Expansion of Recommendations for a Safe Infant Sleeping Environment,” which is included in this issue (www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2011-2220).},
