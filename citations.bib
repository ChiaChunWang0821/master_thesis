	abstract = {In modern face recognition, the conventional pipeline consists of four stages: detect => align => represent => classify. We revisit both the alignment step and the representation step by employing explicit 3D face modeling in order to apply a piecewise affine transformation, and derive a face representation from a nine-layer deep neural network. This deep network involves more than 120 million parameters using several locally connected layers without weight sharing, rather than the standard convolutional layers. Thus we trained it on the largest facial dataset to-date, an identity labeled dataset of four million facial images belonging to more than 4, 000 identities. The learned representations coupling the accurate model-based alignment with the large facial database generalize remarkably well to faces in unconstrained environments, even with a simple classifier. Our method reaches an accuracy of 97.35% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, reducing the error of the current state of the art by more than 27%, closely approaching human-level performance.},

	abstract = {Continuous monitoring of physiological parameters is very often necessary for the evaluation of health conditions, diagnostic reasons and the detection of life or health threatening events. For infants, especially, who cannot provide any feedback about discomfort or health complaints it is an important issue to collect objective data under everyday conditions. The demand of physicians for the development of monitoring and diagnostic systems which are easier to handle and less obtrusive than the commonly used medical systems was the motivation for the presented project. Another motivation was the concern frequently expressed by parents about the danger of apparently life threatening events (ALTE) or even the problems of sudden infants death syndrome (SIDS). The developed sensory baby vest includes fully integrated sensors for the parameters respiration, heart rate, temperature and humidity, to detect excessive sweating, for the continuous monitoring of infants under clinical and home conditions. It will allow the early detection of potential life threatening events calling for rescue as well as the recognition of the development or progression of diseases at an early stage. Health protection or even life-saving thus will be enabled in time. A variety of principles for the measurement of the parameters has been assessed for the integration into garments. Prototypes have been manufactured incorporating the chosen sensing principles with textile and textile-compatible technologies. Currently, the prototypes are clinically tested for durability, handling and signal quality.},

	abstract = {Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is one of the major causes of death among infants during their sleep. To increase the safety of the infants, we matched different emergent research fields for the development of Baby Night Watch. This Smart Wearable System (SWS), developed under the context of the European Texas Instruments Innovation Challenge (TIIC) 2015, is composed by the following elements: a Wearable IoT Device, a Gateway and the H Medical Interface. The Wearable IoT Device is a wireless sensor node integrated in a Chest Belt, and it has the capacity to monitor the following parameters: body temperature, heart and breathing rates and body position. After a minimal data processing, this set of information is sent to the Gateway, via ZigBee technology, and it is accessible to the user through the H Medical Interface. If a critical event occurs, the device will trigger an alarm, visible and audible in the proximity, and sends a distress message to a mobile application. The Baby Night Watch is an important tool for medical studies, since it allows the visualization of previous physiological data and export it to different types of datasets. Experimental tests have proven that the SWS has the potential to identify situations that could be potentially life-threatening for an infant.},

Baby Monitor for remote contactless monitoring of respiratory and heart rate is designed both for consumer and medical infant monitoring applications. Unlike conventional sound- and video-based baby monitors, which do not provide any useful information at infant sleep time (no sounds or static picture) the devices allow permanent parental control and effectively prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) from occurring. SIDS is reported to be leading death cause of healthy infants after one month age.},

	abstract = {Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the major cause of death for infants aged one week to twelve months. The SIDS rate has declined owing to the awareness of caregivers and parents, but the rate is still high even in developed countries because of the difficulty in rescuing the infant immediately. Respiration, which can reflect various physiological conditions, is a basic but vital function for infants. Therefore, this study presents a respiration monitoring system with a video camera positioned in front of an infant to non-invasively detect the infant's respiratory frequency. The proposed system can continuously monitor the infant to detect unusual occurrences in the infant's respiration, to alert caregivers to attend to the infant immediately and reduce potential injuries from SIDS and other respiratory-related disease. The proposed system contains four major stages, including motion detection, candidate point extraction, respiration point selection, and respiratory frequency calculation. During motion detection the system captures images from video and decides whether to conduct the following stages. If no obvious motion is detected in the input frames, then SIDS may have occurred in the infant, and the system extracts candidate points by some spatial characteristics. Based on these points, the system then selects respiration points using a fuzzy integral technique with four temporal characteristics, including entropy, period, skewness, and kurtosis. Finally, the infant's respiratory frequency is calculated. Experimental data are obtained from ten infants, in 48 sequences with a total length of 150 minutes. The experimental results show that the proposed system is robust and efficient.},
