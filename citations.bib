	abstract = {Continuous monitoring of physiological parameters is very often necessary for the evaluation of health conditions, diagnostic reasons and the detection of life or health threatening events. For infants, especially, who cannot provide any feedback about discomfort or health complaints it is an important issue to collect objective data under everyday conditions. The demand of physicians for the development of monitoring and diagnostic systems which are easier to handle and less obtrusive than the commonly used medical systems was the motivation for the presented project. Another motivation was the concern frequently expressed by parents about the danger of apparently life threatening events (ALTE) or even the problems of sudden infants death syndrome (SIDS). The developed sensory baby vest includes fully integrated sensors for the parameters respiration, heart rate, temperature and humidity, to detect excessive sweating, for the continuous monitoring of infants under clinical and home conditions. It will allow the early detection of potential life threatening events calling for rescue as well as the recognition of the development or progression of diseases at an early stage. Health protection or even life-saving thus will be enabled in time. A variety of principles for the measurement of the parameters has been assessed for the integration into garments. Prototypes have been manufactured incorporating the chosen sensing principles with textile and textile-compatible technologies. Currently, the prototypes are clinically tested for durability, handling and signal quality.},

	abstract = {Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is one of the major causes of death among infants during their sleep. To increase the safety of the infants, we matched different emergent research fields for the development of Baby Night Watch. This Smart Wearable System (SWS), developed under the context of the European Texas Instruments Innovation Challenge (TIIC) 2015, is composed by the following elements: a Wearable IoT Device, a Gateway and the H Medical Interface. The Wearable IoT Device is a wireless sensor node integrated in a Chest Belt, and it has the capacity to monitor the following parameters: body temperature, heart and breathing rates and body position. After a minimal data processing, this set of information is sent to the Gateway, via ZigBee technology, and it is accessible to the user through the H Medical Interface. If a critical event occurs, the device will trigger an alarm, visible and audible in the proximity, and sends a distress message to a mobile application. The Baby Night Watch is an important tool for medical studies, since it allows the visualization of previous physiological data and export it to different types of datasets. Experimental tests have proven that the SWS has the potential to identify situations that could be potentially life-threatening for an infant.},

	doi = {10.1109/DICTA.2015.7371224},
	abstract = {Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the major cause of death for infants aged one week to twelve months. The SIDS rate has declined owing to the awareness of caregivers and parents, but the rate is still high even in developed countries because of the difficulty in rescuing the infant immediately. Respiration, which can reflect various physiological conditions, is a basic but vital function for infants. Therefore, this study presents a respiration monitoring system with a video camera positioned in front of an infant to non-invasively detect the infant's respiratory frequency. The proposed system can continuously monitor the infant to detect unusual occurrences in the infant's respiration, to alert caregivers to attend to the infant immediately and reduce potential injuries from SIDS and other respiratory-related disease. The proposed system contains four major stages, including motion detection, candidate point extraction, respiration point selection, and respiratory frequency calculation. During motion detection the system captures images from video and decides whether to conduct the following stages. If no obvious motion is detected in the input frames, then SIDS may have occurred in the infant, and the system extracts candidate points by some spatial characteristics. Based on these points, the system then selects respiration points using a fuzzy integral technique with four temporal characteristics, including entropy, period, skewness, and kurtosis. Finally, the infant's respiratory frequency is calculated. Experimental data are obtained from ten infants, in 48 sequences with a total length of 150 minutes. The experimental results show that the proposed system is robust and efficient.},

	abstract = {Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, also known as SIDS, is the leading cause of mortality in infants from one month to one year of age. We propose a video-based baby monitoring system with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities to help shorten the response time of SIDS cases. Using a video amplification technique developed at MIT dubbed “Eulerian Magnification” to amplify subtle movements, we can compare pixel color differences in frames for breathing detection in a recorded video of a baby. When abnormal movement is detected from the baby, an alarm will be generated to notify the parents or guardians. The expected accuracy is over 98\% for a baby monitor that is intended to be a noninvasive, low cost and efficient solution. The major monitoring situation we considered is during night time, therefore we used a night vision camera for the tests. The camera frame was focused in the size of a crib, and hence there is no concern about losing the sight of the infant which would cause monitoring failure. Currently our team has accomplished the algorithm design and alarm generating design. We consider that making it works in real-time and on an independent IoT board are the future work to complete this project.},

Furthermore, we extend and adapt the recently developed models that capture data-dependent uncertainty from noisy observations for our application. The experimental results show significant improvements on YunInfants dataset across most of the tasks over the models that simply adopt the regular cross-entropy losses without addressing the effect of the underlying uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) causes infants under one year of age to die inexplicably. One of the most important external factors, also called an "outside stressor," that is responsible for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), is the sleeping position of the baby. According to past research, the risk of SIDS increases when the baby sleeps facedown on the stomach. We propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based computer-vision system that estimates the sleeping pose of the baby and alerts caregivers on their mobile phones within a few seconds of the baby moving to the hazardous facedown sleeping position. The system has a low computational load and a low memory footprint. This characteristic allows the system to be embedded in low power edge devices such as certain baby monitors. Processing at the edge also alleviates privacy concerns with regards to sending images into the network. We experimented with various numbers of convolutional processing units and dense layers as well as the number of convolutional kernels to arrive at the optimal production configuration. We observed a consistently high accuracy of detection of infant sleeping position changes from turning to facedown positions with a potential towards even higher accuracies with caregiver feedback for model retraining. Therefore, this system is a viable candidate for consideration as a non-intrusive solution to assist in preventing SIDS.},

	abstract = {Though tremendous strides have been made in uncontrolled face detection, accurate and efficient 2D face alignment and 3D face reconstruction in-the-wild remain an open challenge. In this paper, we present a novel single-shot, multi-level face localisation method, named RetinaFace, which unifies face box prediction, 2D facial landmark localisation and 3D vertices regression under one common target: point regression on the image plane. To fill the data gap, we manually annotated five facial landmarks on the WIDER FACE dataset and employed a semi-automatic annotation pipeline to generate 3D vertices for face images from the WIDER FACE, AFLW and FDDB datasets. Based on extra annotations, we propose a mutually beneficial regression target for 3D face reconstruction, that is predicting 3D vertices projected on the image plane constrained by a common 3D topology. The proposed 3D face reconstruction branch can be easily incorporated, without any optimisation difficulty, in parallel with the existing box and 2D landmark regression branches during joint training. Extensive experimental results show that RetinaFace can simultaneously achieve stable face detection, accurate 2D face alignment and robust 3D face reconstruction while being efficient through single-shot inference.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

Due to the limited computing resource in such scenarios, it is usually difficult to meet the need of both accuracy and speed. Most detectors cannot detect small face accurately or the detection speed will slow down. To address this challenge, we propose a novel face detector in which the basic framework is a single shot multibox detector (SSD), and name it Face SSD. In order to accelerate the detection speed of Face SSD and improve the detection accuracy, we make contributions in the following three aspects: we improved the structure of ShuffleNet V2 and use it as the backbone network; then we proposed a modified prediction module (MPM) to improve recall of small faces; finally we introduced a scale-equitable face detection framework to match face better. Experimental results show that Face SSD runs 40 frames per second (FPS) on CPU and 110 FPS on GPU. We train Face SSD on WIDER FACE - a face detection benchmark. The detector has also achieved excellent performance on FDDB, a benchmark for face detection in unconstrained settings.},

This paper introduced the process of building skin color model based on ellipse clustering and detection to image with this skin color model. Before the skin color model building, we analysed color space and chose lighten-unrelated YCbCr space. Because of the effect of environment when get the image, we compensated illumination with logarithm transformation and filter the right light based on statistic. Also, in order to improve the detecting efficiency, we import an ponderance named Ct to present the number of skin pixels. If Ct lower than a threshold, we look it as non-skin pixels. The experiment proved that this skin color model can detect the skin pixels more effectively and have high robust. Compared to the traditional skin color model such as regional model, single gauss model etc, the algorithmical complexity, detecting rate and error detect rate have evident improvement.},

	abstract = {To investigate the recurrence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) among siblings, the authors analyzed data for all 352,475 mothers whose first and second single births were reported to the Medical Birth Registry of Norway during 1967-1988. Recurrence of stillbirths from the 16th week of gestation onward and infant deaths other than SIDS were also studied. Relative risk of recurrence for SIDS was 5.8 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-13.2); for asphyxia- and immaturity-related infant deaths, 12.5 (9.2-17.4); for congenital malformations, 7.2 (4.7-11.0); and for other causes of infant death, 8.0 (2.0-22.1). Deaths due to infections did not recur. Similar categories of infant deaths had higher overall relative risk, 9.1, compared with 1.6 for dissimilar categories. Previous early stillbirth (16-27 weeks) had a high recurrence (relative risk (RR) = 21.8, 95\% CI 17.5-26.9), while late stillbirth ({\textgreater} or = 28 weeks) had lower recurrence (RR = 4.6, 95\% CI 3.7-5.8). Previous SIDS was associated with an increased risk of all other types of loss. In contrast, previous late stillbirth and previous asphyxia- and immaturity-related infant deaths were associated with a reduced risk of subsequent SIDS (RR = 0.31, 95\% CI 0.08-0.84, and RR = 0.23, 95\% CI 0.01-1.13, respectively). In conclusion, as with other infant and fetal deaths, SIDS deaths showed strong sibship aggregation consistent with a genetic susceptibility in subsets of SIDS that may interact with environmental factors. The authors also suggest common pregnancy-specific risk factors for late stillbirths, asphyxia- and immaturity-related infant deaths, and SIDS.},

METHODS: We analyzed data from a population-based case-control study of 260 SIDS deaths that occurred in Chicago between 1993 and 1996 and an equal number of matched living controls to determine the association between SIDS and factors in the sleep environment and other variables related to infant care.
RESULTS: The racial/ethnic composition of the study groups was 75.0\% black; 13.1\% Hispanic white; and 11.9\% non-Hispanic white. Several factors related to the sleep environment during last sleep were associated with higher risk of SIDS: placement in the prone position (unadjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2.4; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7-3.4), soft surface (OR: 5.1; 95\% CI: 3.1-8.3), pillow use (OR: 2.5; 95\% CI: 1.5-4.2), face and/or head covered with bedding (OR: 2.5; 95\% CI: 1.3-4.6), bed sharing overall (OR: 2.7; 95\% CI: 1.8-4.2), bed sharing with parent(s) alone (OR: 1.9; 95\% CI: 1.2-3.1), and bed sharing in other combinations (OR: 5.4; 95\% CI: 2.8-10.2). Pacifier use was associated with decreased risk (unadjusted OR: 0.3; 95\% CI: 0.2-0.5), as was breastfeeding either ever (OR: 0.2; 95\% CI: 0.1-0.3) or currently (OR: 0.2; 95\% CI: 0.1-0.4). In a multivariate model, several factors remained significant: prone sleep position, soft surface, pillow use, bed sharing other than with parent(s) alone, and not using a pacifier.
CONCLUSIONS: To lower further the SIDS rate among black and other racial/ethnic groups, prone sleeping, the use of soft bedding and pillows, and some types of bed sharing should be reduced.},

METHODS: Data from international vital statistics, epidemiologic studies of SIDS risk factors, and studies of outcomes of public health interventions that advocated nonprone sleeping to reduce the risk for SIDS were discussed at a meeting held by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) with cosponsorship from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) on January 13, and 14, 1994.
RESULTS: Trends in postneonatal mortality and SIDS rates from 1980 through 1992 were evaluated for Australia, Britain, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United States. All of the countries that experienced a rapid decline in prone sleeping also had reductions of approximately 50\% in their SIDS rates. Postneonatal mortality rates dropped as well, with the reduction in SIDS being the primary contributor to the reported declines. The major behavioral change in all targeted populations was in sleep position. No significant changes were observed in the proportion of parents who smoked cigarettes, or in breast-feeding. Preliminary data from population-based studies showed there were no reported adverse outcomes associated with a change to side or back sleep position, such as an increase in deaths due to aspiration or in apparent life-threatening events.
CONCLUSION: The overwhelming opinion of the assembled experts was that the evidence justified greater effort to reach parents with the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendation that healthy infants, when being put down to sleep, be positioned on their side or back.},

Within New Zealand the rate is higher in Maori than in non-Maori (predominantly European infants) and higher in South Island than in North Island. The National Cot Death Prevention Programme aims to reduce the prevalence of four modifiable risk factors for SIDS, namely infants sleeping prone, maternal smoking, lack of breast feeding, and infants sharing a bed with another person. The aim of this study is to describe the total postneonatal and total SIDS mortality in New Zealand from 1986 to 1992. Official publications from 1986 to 1990 and preliminary death notifications for 1991 and 1992 were examined. Deaths from all causes in the postneonatal age group (28 days to 1 year) and the total number of deaths from SIDS irrespective of age decreased markedly in 1990 and has continued to decrease. This decrease occurred particularly in non-Maori groups, in South Island, and in the winter months. The proportion of infants sleeping in a prone position has decreased from 43\% to less than 5\%. This suggests that the prone position is causally related to SIDS. The mechanism appears to be related directly or indirectly to environmental temperature.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a leading cause of postneonatal mortality among American Indians, a group whose infant death rate is consistently above the US national average.
OBJECTIVE: To determine prenatal and postnatal risk factors for SIDS among American Indians.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Population-based case-control study of 33 SIDS infants and 66 matched living controls among American Indians in South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, and Iowa enrolled from December 1992 to November 1996 and investigated using standardized parental interview, medical record abstraction, autopsy protocol, and infant death review.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Association of SIDS with maternal socioeconomic and behavioral factors, health care utilization, and infant care practices.
RESULTS: The proportions of case and control infants who were usually placed prone to sleep (15.2\% and 13.6\%, respectively), who shared a bed with parents (59.4\% and 55.4\%), or whose mothers smoked during pregnancy (69.7\% and 54.6\%) were similar. However, mothers of 72.7\% of case infants and 45.5\% of control infants engaged in binge drinking during pregnancy. Conditional logistic regression revealed significant associations between SIDS and 2 or more layers of clothing on the infant (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.2; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-26.5), any visits by a public health nurse (aOR, 0.2; 95\% CI, 0.1-0.8), periconceptional maternal alcohol use (aOR, 6.2; 95\% CI, 1.6-23.3), and maternal first-trimester binge drinking (aOR, 8.2; 95\% CI, 1.9-35.3).
CONCLUSIONS: Public health nurse visits, maternal alcohol use during the periconceptional period and first trimester, and layers of clothing are important risk factors for SIDS among Northern Plains Indians. Strengthening public health nurse visiting programs and programs to reduce alcohol consumption among women of childbearing age could potentially reduce the high rate of SIDS.},

	doi = {10.1542/peds.106.3.e41},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prone sleep and unsafe sleep surfaces increase the risk of sudden infant death. Recent epidemiologic studies also suggest that when an infant's head or face is covered by bedding, or when a sleep surface is shared with others, the risk of dying increases. The inference of a causal role for these risk factors is supported by physiologic studies and by the consistent finding that fewer infants die when risk factors are reduced. The prevalence of most of these risk factors in infant deaths in the United States is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of several important risk factors related to sleep practices among a defined population of infants dying suddenly and unexpectedly.
METHODS: In this population-based study, we retrospectively reviewed death-scene information and medical examiners' investigations of deaths in the city of St Louis and St Louis County between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 1997. Because of the potential for diagnostic overlap, all deaths involving infants {\textless}2 years old with the diagnoses of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), accidental suffocation, or cause undetermined were included.
RESULTS: The deaths of 119 infants were studied. Their mean age was 109.3 days (range: 6-350). The diagnoses were SIDS in 88 deaths, accidental suffocation in 16, and undetermined in 15. Infants were found prone in 61.1\% of cases and were found on a sleep surface not designed for infants in 75.9\%. The head or face was covered by bedding in 29.4\%. A shared sleep surface was the site of death in 47.1\%. Only 8.4\% of deaths involved infants found nonprone and alone, with head and face uncovered.
CONCLUSIONS: Using detailed death-scene descriptions, we found that similar unsafe sleeping practices occurred in the large majority of cases diagnosed as SIDS, accidental suffocation, and cause undetermined. Considering these diagnoses together may be useful in public health campaigns during a time when there may be diagnostic overlap. Regardless of the diagnosis, recommendations that infants sleep supine on firm sleep surfaces that lessen the risk of entrapment or head covering have the potential to save many lives. Campaigns are needed to heighten awareness of these messages and of the risks of dangerous bedsharing.},

METHODS: We analyzed data from a case-control study (58 infants with SIDS and 120 control infants) and a prospective cohort study (22 infants with SIDS and 213 control infants) in Tasmania. Interactions were examined in matched analyses with a multiplicative model of interaction.
RESULTS: In the case-control study, SIDS was significantly associated with sleeping in the prone position, as compared with other positions (unadjusted odds ratio, 4.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 9.6). The strength of this association was increased among infants who slept on natural-fiber mattresses (P = 0.05), infants who were swaddled (P = 0.09), infants who slept in heated rooms (P = 0.006), and infants who had had a recent illness (P = 0.02). These variables had no significant effect on infants who did not sleep in the prone position. A history of recent illness was significantly associated with SIDS among infants who slept prone (odds ratio, 5.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 19) but not among infants who slept in other positions (odds ratio, 0.83). In the cohort study, the risk of SIDS was greater among infants who slept prone on natural-fiber mattresses (odds ratio, 6.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 33) than among infants who slept prone on other types of mattresses (odds ratio, 1.8).
CONCLUSIONS: When infants sleep prone, the elevated risk of SIDS is increased by each of four factors: the use of natural-fiber mattresses, swaddling, recent illness, and the use of heating in bedrooms.},

We assessed this assumption in an investigation of infant deaths that occurred during sleep on cushions filled with polystyrene beads.
METHODS: We obtained data on 25 deaths from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. We also used mechanical and animal models to study physiologic aspects of ventilation relevant to these results, by simulating the effects on an infant of breathing into a cushion. We measured the effects of softness, malleability (molding of the cushion about an infant's head), airflow resistance, and rebreathing of expired gases.
RESULTS: All 25 study infants were prone when found dead, and at least 88 percent were face down with nose and mouth obstructed by the cushion. SIDS was the diagnosis in 19 of the 23 infants who underwent autopsy. Our findings show, however, that the cushion would have limited movement of the infant's head to obtain fresh air, and the amount of rebreathing we estimated to have occurred in the infants was lethal in a rabbit model.
CONCLUSIONS: Accidental suffocation by rebreathing was the most likely cause of death in most of the 25 infants studied. Consequently, there is a need to reassess the cause of death in the 28 to 52 percent of the victims of SIDS who are found with their faces straight down. Safety regulations setting standards for softness, malleability, and the potential for rebreathing are needed for infant bedding.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the consequences of getting the head covered by bedding (fiber quilt) on carbon dioxide (CO2) accumulation around the face, behavior, and physiologic responses during prone and supine sleep in infants to add understanding to why victims of sudden infant death syndrome are often found under the bedding. METHPDOLOGY: Of 33 healthy term, usually nonprone sleeping infants, behavior and computerized polysomnography were successfully recorded for 30 during prone and supine sleep at 21/2 months and for 23 prone and 25 supine at 5 months.
RESULTS: For both ages and body positions, covering the head resulted in significant CO2 accumulation around the face, fewer apneas (3 to 10 seconds), shorter duration of apneas after sighs, higher heart and respiratory rates, and peripheral skin temperature. Differences were generally greater at 21/2 than at 5 months. While covered, the prone position was associated with higher CO2 levels close to the face, slightly higher transcutaneous PCO2, and higher heart rates and peripheral skin temperatures than the supine position. In the supine position 23\% were able to remove the cover from the head at 21/2 and 60\% at 5 months, whereas only 1 infant of 5 months managed to remove the cover when prone.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed responses are consistent with a potential for distress when the head is covered, particularly when placed prone. Probably most important with respect to sudden infant death syndrome is the infants' inability to remove the bedding from the head upon awakening from prone sleep.},

	abstract = {Despite a major decrease in the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) since the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released its recommendation in 1992 that infants be placed for sleep in a nonprone position, this decline has plateaued in recent years. Concurrently, other causes of sudden unexpected infant death occurring during sleep (sleep-related deaths), including suffocation, asphyxia, and entrapment, and ill-defined or unspecified causes of death have increased in incidence, particularly since the AAP published its last statement on SIDS in 2005. It has become increasingly important to address these other causes of sleep-related infant death. Many of the modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors for SIDS and suffocation are strikingly similar. The AAP, therefore, is expanding its recommendations from being only SIDS-focused to focusing on a safe sleep environment that can reduce the risk of all sleep-related infant deaths including SIDS. The recommendations described in this report include supine positioning, use of a firm sleep surface, breastfeeding, room-sharing without bed-sharing, routine immunization, consideration of a pacifier, and avoidance of soft bedding, overheating, and exposure to tobacco smoke, alcohol, and illicit drugs. The rationale for these recommendations is discussed in detail in this technical report. The recommendations are published in the accompanying “Policy Statement—Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and Other Sleep-Related Infant Deaths: Expansion of Recommendations for a Safe Infant Sleeping Environment,” which is included in this issue (www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2011-2220).},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to design a low-power human physiological parameters monitoring system which can monitor six vital parameters simultaneously based on wearable body sensor network. Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a low-power multiple physiological parameters monitoring system (MPMS) which comprises four subsystems. These are: electrocardiogram (ECG)/respiration (RESP) parameters monitoring subsystem with embedded algorithms; blood oxygen (SpO2)/pulse rate (PR)/body temperature (BT)/blood pressure (BP) parameters monitoring subsystem with embedded algorithms; main control subsystem which is in charge of system-level power management, communication and interaction design; and upper computer software subsystem which manipulates system function and analyzes data. Findings Results have successfully demonstrated monitoring human ECG, RESP, PR, SpO2, BP and BT simultaneously using the MPMS device. In addition, the power reduction technique developed in this work at the physical/hardware level is effective. Reliability of algorithms developed for monitoring these parameters is assessed by Fluke Prosim8 Vital Signs Simulators (produced by Fluke Corp. USA). Practical implications The MPMS device provides long-term health monitoring without interference from normal personal activities, which potentially allows applications in real-time daily healthcare monitoring, chronic diseases monitoring, elderly monitoring, human emotions recognization and so on. Originality/value First, a power reduction technique at the physical/hardware level is designed to realize low power consumption. Second, the proposed MPMS device enables simultaneously monitoring six key parameters. Third, unlike most monitoring systems in bulk size, the proposed system is much smaller (118 × 58 × 18.5 mm3, 140 g total weight). In addition, a comfortable smart shirt is fabricated to accommodate the portable device, offering reliable measurements.},

Upon experiencing poor signal reception in the latter network tier when the patient moves, the AP may instruct the sensor network coordinator to forward vital signs data through one of the wearable sensor nodes acting as a temporary relay if the sensor-AP link has a stronger signal. Our practical implementation of the proposed scheme reveals that this relayed data operation decreases packet loss rate down to 20\% of the value otherwise obtained when solely using the point-to-point, coordinator-AP link. In particular, the wrist location yields the best results over alternative body sensor positions when patients walk at a 0.5 m/s.},

The NAPS system's measures of heart rate and breathing rate were compared to ECG, pulse oximetry, and respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP). The subjects were split into a training dataset and a validation dataset, maintaining similar demographics in each set. The NAPS system accurately detected heart rate, averaged over the prescribed 30-s epochs, to within less than 2.72 beats per minute of ECG, and accurately detected breathing rate, averaged over the same epochs, to within 2.10 breaths per minute of RIP bands used in polysomnography.},

Among the many signals and quantities observable, the ones related to the heart and particularly the lung's activity are of primary interest. Today the majority of the measurement methods used for the assessment of the respiration rate are based on invasive methods (spriometry) which are often included into mechanical ventilator to which the patients, in need of assisted breathing, are attached. In this paper an optical, non-contact measurement method for monitoring of the respiration rate in pre-term infants is reported. It is based on the assessment of abdominal wall movements detected by a laser Doppler vibrometer and can be operated at a distance from the patient and outside the incubator. A total of 9 preterm patients have been monitored; respiration rates measured by a reference instrument (BabyLog 8000 Draeger plus) and the proposed non-contact method have been measured for a period of time of 60s. Data have been compared using the Bland-Altman analysis and results demonstrate an optimal correlation (R=0.97) among data and an uncertainty of the proposed method of ± 0.13s (K=2).},

In this paper, we propose a visual context-aware-based sleeping-respiration measurement system that measures the respiration information of elderly sleepers. Accurate respiration measurement requires considering all possible contexts for the sleeping person. The proposed system consists of a body-motion-context-detection subsystem, a respiration-context-detection subsystem, and a fast motion-vector-estimation-based respiration measurement subsystem. The system yielded accurate respiratory measurements for our study population.},

According to the elder's relatively obvious and stable routine of daily activities, this paper proposes a statistical approach based on machine vision to build an elder indoor and outdoor activity model (EIOAM) through analysis of the elder's daily activity data in the main activity places and the entry/exit places collected by the omni-directional vision sensor (ODVS). Since the elder's daily routine varies with the alternating of seasons and growing of age, the model should learn the routine of activities adaptively. This model is able to detect and predict the abnormal activities of the elder through detecting the significant deviations of the activity data in spatial and temporal aspects. By using this model, one can not only detect the abnormal activities happened in sight of the vision sensor (indoor), but also out of sight (outdoor). Thus provides a new methodology for the remote home care of the elder who lives alone},

An array of CO2 sensors is mounted around the infant in the bars of the crib and they are wire-connected to a circuit board located at the end of the crib. This board consists of a processing circuit and a wireless transmission module transmitting signals to a compact receiver at the caregivers' location. We have designed and assembled the modules in printed circuit boards (PCBs) with commercial metal-oxide based CO2 sensors. The sensor has been tested in sensitivity, selectivity and humidity dependence. The module has been tested with its transmission capability in various environments.

	abstract = {Many children on autism spectrum have atypical behavioral expressions of engagement compared to their neu-rotypical peers. In this paper, we investigate the performance of deep learning models in the task of automated engagement estimation from face images of children with autism. Specifically, we use the video data of 30 children with different cultural backgrounds (Asia vs. Europe) recorded during a single session of a robot-assisted autism therapy. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed deep architectures for the target task, including within- and across-culture evaluations, as well as when using the child-independent and child-dependent settings. We also introduce a novel deep learning model, named CultureNet, which efficiently leverages the multi-cultural data when performing the adaptation of the proposed deep architecture to the target culture and child. We show that due to the highly heterogeneous nature of the image data of children with autism, the child-independent models lead to overall poor estimation of target engagement levels. On the other hand, when a small amount of data of target children is used to enhance the model learning, the estimation performance on the held-out data from those children increases significantly. This is the first time that the effects of individual and cultural differences in children with autism have empirically been studied in the context of deep learning performed directly from face images.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICCV.2015.425},
	abstract = {Predicting face attributes in the wild is challenging due to complex face variations. We propose a novel deep learning framework for attribute prediction in the wild. It cascades two CNNs, LNet and ANet, which are fine-tuned jointly with attribute tags, but pre-trained differently. LNet is pre-trained by massive general object categories for face localization, while ANet is pre-trained by massive face identities for attribute prediction. This framework not only outperforms the state-of-the-art with a large margin, but also reveals valuable facts on learning face representation. (1) It shows how the performances of face localization (LNet) and attribute prediction (ANet) can be improved by different pre-training strategies. (2) It reveals that although the filters of LNet are fine-tuned only with image-level attribute tags, their response maps over entire images have strong indication of face locations. This fact enables training LNet for face localization with only image-level annotations, but without face bounding boxes or landmarks, which are required by all attribute recognition works. (3) It also demonstrates that the high-level hidden neurons of ANet automatically discover semantic concepts after pre-training with massive face identities, and such concepts are significantly enriched after fine-tuning with attribute tags. Each attribute can be well explained with a sparse linear combination of these concepts.},

On the other hand, epistemic uncertainty accounts for uncertainty in the model -- uncertainty which can be explained away given enough data. Traditionally it has been difficult to model epistemic uncertainty in computer vision, but with new Bayesian deep learning tools this is now possible. We study the benefits of modeling epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty in Bayesian deep learning models for vision tasks. For this we present a Bayesian deep learning framework combining input-dependent aleatoric uncertainty together with epistemic uncertainty. We study models under the framework with per-pixel semantic segmentation and depth regression tasks. Further, our explicit uncertainty formulation leads to new loss functions for these tasks, which can be interpreted as learned attenuation. This makes the loss more robust to noisy data, also giving new state-of-the-art results on segmentation and depth regression benchmarks.},

In this paper we introduce methods for automatically detecting and classifying hand-head occlusions in sign language videos. Linguistically, hand-head occlusions are an important and interesting subject of study as the head is a structural place of articulation in many signs. Our method combines easily calculable local video properties with more global hand tracking. The experiments carried out with videos of the Suvi on-line dictionary of Finnish Sign Language show that the sensitivity of the proposed local method in detecting occlusion events is 92.6\%. When global hand tracking is combined in the method, the specificity can reach the level of 93.7\% while still maintaining the detection sensitivity above 90\%.},

	doi = {10.1109/CVPR.2017.53},
	abstract = {Detecting faces with occlusions is a challenging task due to two main reasons: 1) the absence of large datasets of masked faces, and 2) the absence of facial cues from the masked regions. To address these two issues, this paper first introduces a dataset, denoted as MAFA, with 30, 811 Internet images and 35, 806 masked faces. Faces in the dataset have various orientations and occlusion degrees, while at least one part of each face is occluded by mask. Based on this dataset, we further propose LLE-CNNs for masked face detection, which consist of three major modules. The Proposal module first combines two pre-trained CNNs to extract candidate facial regions from the input image and represent them with high dimensional descriptors. After that, the Embedding module is incorporated to turn such descriptors into a similarity-based descriptor by using locally linear embedding (LLE) algorithm and the dictionaries trained on a large pool of synthesized normal faces, masked faces and non-faces. In this manner, many missing facial cues can be largely recovered and the influences of noisy cues introduced by diversified masks can be greatly alleviated. Finally, the Verification module is incorporated to identify candidate facial regions and refine their positions by jointly performing the classification and regression tasks within a unified CNN. Experimental results on the MAFA dataset show that the proposed approach remarkably outperforms 6 state-of-the-arts by at least 15.6\%.},

For real-world applications in industrial and commercial scenarios, engineers and developers are often faced with the requirement of constrained time budget. In this paper, we investigate the accuracy of CNNs under constrained time cost. Under this constraint, the designs of the network architectures should exhibit as trade-offs among the factors like depth, numbers of filters, filter sizes, etc. With a series of controlled comparisons, we progressively modify a baseline model while preserving its time complexity. This is also helpful for understanding the importance of the factors in network designs. We present an architecture that achieves very competitive accuracy in the ImageNet dataset (11.8\% top-5 error, 10-view test), yet is 20\% faster than “AlexNet” [14] (16.0\% top-5 error, 10-view test).},

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

For 2D correlation, the root filter is constrained to be low rank, so that 2D correlation can be calculated by more efficient linear combination of 1D correlations. A proximal gradient algorithm is adopted to progressively learn the low rank filter in a discriminative manner. For cascade part pruning, neighborhood aware cascade is proposed to capture the dependence in neighborhood regions for aggressive pruning. Instead of explicit computation of part scores, hypotheses can be pruned by scores of neighborhoods under the first order approximation. For HOG feature extraction, look-up tables are constructed to replace expensive calculations of orientation partition and magnitude with simpler matrix index operations. Extensive experiments show that (a) the proposed method is 4 times faster than the current fastest DPM method with similar accuracy on Pascal VOC, (b) the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on pedestrian and face detection task with frame-rate speed.},

Specifically, our method achieves a high recall rate of 90.99\% on the challenging FDDB benchmark, outperforming the state-of-the-art method [23] by a large margin of 2.91\%. Importantly, we consider finding faces from a new perspective through scoring facial parts responses by their spatial structure and arrangement. The scoring mechanism is carefully formulated considering challenging cases where faces are only partially visible. This consideration allows our network to detect faces under severe occlusion and unconstrained pose variation, which are the main difficulty and bottleneck of most existing face detection approaches. We show that despite the use of DCN, our network can achieve practical runtime speed.},

Consequently, effective models for the problem tend to be computationally prohibitive. To address these two conflicting challenges, we propose a cascade architecture built on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with very powerful discriminative capability, while maintaining high performance. The proposed CNN cascade operates at multiple resolutions, quickly rejects the background regions in the fast low resolution stages, and carefully evaluates a small number of challenging candidates in the last high resolution stage. To improve localization effectiveness, and reduce the number of candidates at later stages, we introduce a CNN-based calibration stage after each of the detection stages in the cascade. The output of each calibration stage is used to adjust the detection window position for input to the subsequent stage. The proposed method runs at 14 FPS on a single CPU core for VGA-resolution images and 100 FPS using a GPU, and achieves state-of-the-art detection performance on two public face detection benchmarks.},

As successful cases exist in several visual problems, a unified framework is absent. In this paper, we revisit two widely used approaches in computer vision, namely filtered channel features and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and absorb merits from both by proposing an integrated method called Convolutional Channel Features (CCF). CCF transfers low-level features from pre-trained CNN models to feed the boosting forest model. With the combination of CNN features and boosting forest, CCF benefits from the richer capacity in feature representation compared with channel features, as well as lower cost in computation and storage compared with end-to-end CNN methods. We show that CCF serves as a good way of tailoring pre-trained CNN models to diverse tasks without fine-tuning the whole network to each task by achieving state-of-the-art performances in pedestrian detection, face detection, edge detection and object proposal generation.},

	abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of multi-view face detection. While there has been significant research on this problem, current state-of-the-art approaches for this task require annotation of facial landmarks, e.g. TSM [25], or annotation of face poses [28, 22]. They also require training dozens of models to fully capture faces in all orientations, e.g. 22 models in HeadHunter method [22]. In this paper we propose Deep Dense Face Detector (DDFD), a method that does not require pose/landmark annotation and is able to detect faces in a wide range of orientations using a single model based on deep convolutional neural networks. The proposed method has minimal complexity; unlike other recent deep learning object detection methods [9], it does not require additional components such as segmentation, bounding-box regression, or SVM classifiers. Furthermore, we analyzed scores of the proposed face detector for faces in different orientations and found that 1) the proposed method is able to detect faces from different angles and can handle occlusion to some extent, 2) there seems to be a correlation between distribution of positive examples in the training set and scores of the proposed face detector. The latter suggests that the proposed method's performance can be further improved by using better sampling strategies and more sophisticated data augmentation techniques. Evaluations on popular face detection benchmark datasets show that our single-model face detector algorithm has similar or better performance compared to the previous methods, which are more complex and require annotations of either different poses or facial landmarks.},

While many subsequences have improved the work with more powerful learning algorithms, the feature representation used for face detection still can't meet the demand for effectively and efficiently handling faces with large appearance variance in the wild. To solve this bottleneck, we borrow the concept of channel features to the face detection domain, which extends the image channel to diverse types like gradient magnitude and oriented gradient histograms and therefore encodes rich information in a simple form. We adopt a novel variant called aggregate channel features, make a full exploration of feature design, and discover a multi-scale version of features with better performance. To deal with poses of faces in the wild, we propose a multi-view detection approach featuring score re-ranking and detection adjustment. Following the learning pipelines in Viola-Jones framework, the multi-view face detector using aggregate channel features shows competitive performance against state-of-the-art algorithms on AFW and FDDB testsets, while runs at 42 FPS on VGA images.},

Unlike previous regression-based approaches, we directly learn a vectorial regression function to infer the whole facial shape (a set of facial landmarks) from the image and explicitly minimize the alignment errors over the training data. The inherent shape constraint is naturally encoded into the regressor in a cascaded learning framework and applied from coarse to fine during the test, without using a fixed parametric shape model as in most previous methods. To make the regression more effective and efficient, we design a two-level boosted regression, shape indexed features and a correlation-based feature selection method. This combination enables us to learn accurate models from large training data in a short time (20 min for 2,000 training images), and run regression extremely fast in test (15 ms for a 87 landmarks shape). Experiments on challenging data show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.},

By introducing 3D face shape model, we use procrustes analysis to achieve pose-free facial landmark initialization. For deformation, the first step uses mean-shift local search with constrained local model to rapidly approach the global optimum. The second step uses component-wise active contours to discriminatively refine the subtle shape variation. Our framework can simultaneously handle face detection, pose-free landmark localization and tracking in real time. Extensive experiments are conducted on both laboratory environmental face databases and face-in-the-wild databases.

	abstract = {Many computer vision problems (e.g., camera calibration, image alignment, structure from motion) are solved through a nonlinear optimization method. It is generally accepted that 2nd order descent methods are the most robust, fast and reliable approaches for nonlinear optimization of a general smooth function. However, in the context of computer vision, 2nd order descent methods have two main drawbacks: (1) The function might not be analytically differentiable and numerical approximations are impractical. (2) The Hessian might be large and not positive definite. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Supervised Descent Method (SDM) for minimizing a Non-linear Least Squares (NLS) function. During training, the SDM learns a sequence of descent directions that minimizes the mean of NLS functions sampled at different points. In testing, SDM minimizes the NLS objective using the learned descent directions without computing the Jacobian nor the Hessian. We illustrate the benefits of our approach in synthetic and real examples, and show how SDM achieves state-of-the-art performance in the problem of facial feature detection.

We further explore RCPR's performance by introducing a novel face dataset focused on occlusion, composed of 1,007 faces presenting a wide range of occlusion patterns.

This is non-trivial since different tasks have different learning difficulties and convergence rates. To address this problem, we formulate a novel tasks-constrained deep model, with task-wise early stopping to facilitate learning convergence. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed task-constrained learning (i) outperforms existing methods, especially in dealing with faces with severe occlusion and pose variation, and (ii) reduces model complexity drastically compared to the state-of-the-art method based on cascaded deep model [21].},

In comparison with the state-of-the-art anchor-based face detection methods, the main advantages of our method are summarized in four aspects. (1) We propose a scale-aware detection network using a wide scale range of layers associated with appropriate scales of anchors to handle faces with various scales, and describe a new equal density principle to ensure anchors with different scales to be evenly distributed on the image. (2) To improve the recall rates of faces with certain scales (e.g., the scales of the faces are quite different from the scales of designed anchors), we design a new anchor matching strategy with scale compensation. (3) We introduce an IoU-aware weighting scheme for each training sample in classification loss calculation to encode samples accurately in training process. (4) Considering the class imbalance issue, a max-out background strategy is used to reduce false positives. Several experiments are conducted on public challenging face detection datasets, i.e., WIDER FACE, AFW, PASCAL Face, FDDB, and MAFA, to demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results and runs at 82.1 FPS for the VGA-resolution images.},

	abstract = {Face detection has been well studied for many years and one of remaining challenges is to detect small, blurred and partially occluded faces in uncontrolled environment. This paper proposes a novel context-assisted single shot face detector, named PyramidBox to handle the hard face detection problem. Observing the importance of the context, we improve the utilization of contextual information in the following three aspects. First, we design a novel context anchor to supervise high-level contextual feature learning by a semi-supervised method, which we call it PyramidAnchors. Second, we propose the Low-level Feature Pyramid Network to combine adequate high-level context semantic feature and Low-level facial feature together, which also allows the PyramidBox to predict faces of all scales in a single shot. Third, we introduce a context-sensitive structure to increase the capacity of prediction network to improve the final accuracy of output. In addition, we use the method of Data-anchor-sampling to augment the training samples across different scales, which increases the diversity of training data for smaller faces. By exploiting the value of context, PyramidBox achieves superior performance among the state-of-the-art over the two common face detection benchmarks, FDDB and WIDER FACE. Our code is available in PaddlePaddle: https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/models/tree/develop/fluid/face\_detection.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICCV.2017.522},
	abstract = {We introduce the Single Stage Headless (SSH) face detector. Unlike two stage proposal-classification detectors, SSH detects faces in a single stage directly from the early convolutional layers in a classification network. SSH is headless. That is, it is able to achieve state-of-the-art results while removing the “head” of its underlying classification network - i.e. all fully connected layers in the VGG-16 which contains a large number of parameters. Additionally, instead of relying on an image pyramid to detect faces with various scales, SSH is scale-invariant by design. We simultaneously detect faces with different scales in a single forward pass of the network, but from different layers. These properties make SSH fast and light-weight. Surprisingly, with a headless VGG-16, SSH beats the ResNet-101-based state-of-the-art on the WIDER dataset. Even though, unlike the current state-of-the-art, SSH does not use an image pyramid and is 5X faster. Moreover, if an image pyramid is deployed, our light-weight network achieves state-of-the-art on all subsets of the WIDER dataset, improving the AP by 2.5\%. SSH also reaches state-of-the-art results on the FDDB and Pascal-Faces datasets while using a small input size, leading to a speed of 50 frames/second on a GPU.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a real-time face detector, named Single Shot Scale-invariant Face Detector (S\${\textasciicircum}3\$FD), which performs superiorly on various scales of faces with a single deep neural network, especially for small faces. Specifically, we try to solve the common problem that anchor-based detectors deteriorate dramatically as the objects become smaller. We make contributions in the following three aspects: 1) proposing a scale-equitable face detection framework to handle different scales of faces well. We tile anchors on a wide range of layers to ensure that all scales of faces have enough features for detection. Besides, we design anchor scales based on the effective receptive field and a proposed equal proportion interval principle; 2) improving the recall rate of small faces by a scale compensation anchor matching strategy; 3) reducing the false positive rate of small faces via a max-out background label. As a consequence, our method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance on all the common face detection benchmarks, including the AFW, PASCAL face, FDDB and WIDER FACE datasets, and can run at 36 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X (Pascal) for VGA-resolution images.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel face detection network with three novel contributions that address three key aspects of face detection, including better feature learning, progressive loss design and anchor assign based data augmentation, respectively. First, we propose a Feature Enhance Module (FEM) for enhancing the original feature maps to extend the single shot detector to dual shot detector. Second, we adopt Progressive Anchor Loss (PAL) computed by two different sets of anchors to effectively facilitate the features. Third, we use an Improved Anchor Matching (IAM) by integrating novel anchor assign strategy into data augmentation to provide better initialization for the regressor. Since these techniques are all related to the two-stream design, we name the proposed network as Dual Shot Face Detector (DSFD). Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks, WIDER FACE and FDDB, demonstrate the superiority of DSFD over the state-of-the-art face detectors.},
