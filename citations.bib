	abstract = {Continuous monitoring of physiological parameters is very often necessary for the evaluation of health conditions, diagnostic reasons and the detection of life or health threatening events. For infants, especially, who cannot provide any feedback about discomfort or health complaints it is an important issue to collect objective data under everyday conditions. The demand of physicians for the development of monitoring and diagnostic systems which are easier to handle and less obtrusive than the commonly used medical systems was the motivation for the presented project. Another motivation was the concern frequently expressed by parents about the danger of apparently life threatening events (ALTE) or even the problems of sudden infants death syndrome (SIDS). The developed sensory baby vest includes fully integrated sensors for the parameters respiration, heart rate, temperature and humidity, to detect excessive sweating, for the continuous monitoring of infants under clinical and home conditions. It will allow the early detection of potential life threatening events calling for rescue as well as the recognition of the development or progression of diseases at an early stage. Health protection or even life-saving thus will be enabled in time. A variety of principles for the measurement of the parameters has been assessed for the integration into garments. Prototypes have been manufactured incorporating the chosen sensing principles with textile and textile-compatible technologies. Currently, the prototypes are clinically tested for durability, handling and signal quality.},

	abstract = {Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is one of the major causes of death among infants during their sleep. To increase the safety of the infants, we matched different emergent research fields for the development of Baby Night Watch. This Smart Wearable System (SWS), developed under the context of the European Texas Instruments Innovation Challenge (TIIC) 2015, is composed by the following elements: a Wearable IoT Device, a Gateway and the H Medical Interface. The Wearable IoT Device is a wireless sensor node integrated in a Chest Belt, and it has the capacity to monitor the following parameters: body temperature, heart and breathing rates and body position. After a minimal data processing, this set of information is sent to the Gateway, via ZigBee technology, and it is accessible to the user through the H Medical Interface. If a critical event occurs, the device will trigger an alarm, visible and audible in the proximity, and sends a distress message to a mobile application. The Baby Night Watch is an important tool for medical studies, since it allows the visualization of previous physiological data and export it to different types of datasets. Experimental tests have proven that the SWS has the potential to identify situations that could be potentially life-threatening for an infant.},

	doi = {10.1109/DICTA.2015.7371224},
	abstract = {Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the major cause of death for infants aged one week to twelve months. The SIDS rate has declined owing to the awareness of caregivers and parents, but the rate is still high even in developed countries because of the difficulty in rescuing the infant immediately. Respiration, which can reflect various physiological conditions, is a basic but vital function for infants. Therefore, this study presents a respiration monitoring system with a video camera positioned in front of an infant to non-invasively detect the infant's respiratory frequency. The proposed system can continuously monitor the infant to detect unusual occurrences in the infant's respiration, to alert caregivers to attend to the infant immediately and reduce potential injuries from SIDS and other respiratory-related disease. The proposed system contains four major stages, including motion detection, candidate point extraction, respiration point selection, and respiratory frequency calculation. During motion detection the system captures images from video and decides whether to conduct the following stages. If no obvious motion is detected in the input frames, then SIDS may have occurred in the infant, and the system extracts candidate points by some spatial characteristics. Based on these points, the system then selects respiration points using a fuzzy integral technique with four temporal characteristics, including entropy, period, skewness, and kurtosis. Finally, the infant's respiratory frequency is calculated. Experimental data are obtained from ten infants, in 48 sequences with a total length of 150 minutes. The experimental results show that the proposed system is robust and efficient.},

	abstract = {Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, also known as SIDS, is the leading cause of mortality in infants from one month to one year of age. We propose a video-based baby monitoring system with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities to help shorten the response time of SIDS cases. Using a video amplification technique developed at MIT dubbed “Eulerian Magnification” to amplify subtle movements, we can compare pixel color differences in frames for breathing detection in a recorded video of a baby. When abnormal movement is detected from the baby, an alarm will be generated to notify the parents or guardians. The expected accuracy is over 98\% for a baby monitor that is intended to be a noninvasive, low cost and efficient solution. The major monitoring situation we considered is during night time, therefore we used a night vision camera for the tests. The camera frame was focused in the size of a crib, and hence there is no concern about losing the sight of the infant which would cause monitoring failure. Currently our team has accomplished the algorithm design and alarm generating design. We consider that making it works in real-time and on an independent IoT board are the future work to complete this project.},

Furthermore, we extend and adapt the recently developed models that capture data-dependent uncertainty from noisy observations for our application. The experimental results show significant improvements on YunInfants dataset across most of the tasks over the models that simply adopt the regular cross-entropy losses without addressing the effect of the underlying uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) causes infants under one year of age to die inexplicably. One of the most important external factors, also called an "outside stressor," that is responsible for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), is the sleeping position of the baby. According to past research, the risk of SIDS increases when the baby sleeps facedown on the stomach. We propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based computer-vision system that estimates the sleeping pose of the baby and alerts caregivers on their mobile phones within a few seconds of the baby moving to the hazardous facedown sleeping position. The system has a low computational load and a low memory footprint. This characteristic allows the system to be embedded in low power edge devices such as certain baby monitors. Processing at the edge also alleviates privacy concerns with regards to sending images into the network. We experimented with various numbers of convolutional processing units and dense layers as well as the number of convolutional kernels to arrive at the optimal production configuration. We observed a consistently high accuracy of detection of infant sleeping position changes from turning to facedown positions with a potential towards even higher accuracies with caregiver feedback for model retraining. Therefore, this system is a viable candidate for consideration as a non-intrusive solution to assist in preventing SIDS.},

Alarms will be triggered if any of the monitored parameters is beyond the preset limits. The system was tested on an infant manikin driven by an infant ventilator. Test outcomes demonstrated that it can reliably measure respiratory rate down to the low respiratory pressure of 3 mmHg peak to peak in addition to the infant position, temperature and carbon monoxide concentration.

	abstract = {Though tremendous strides have been made in uncontrolled face detection, accurate and efficient 2D face alignment and 3D face reconstruction in-the-wild remain an open challenge. In this paper, we present a novel single-shot, multi-level face localisation method, named RetinaFace, which unifies face box prediction, 2D facial landmark localisation and 3D vertices regression under one common target: point regression on the image plane. To fill the data gap, we manually annotated five facial landmarks on the WIDER FACE dataset and employed a semi-automatic annotation pipeline to generate 3D vertices for face images from the WIDER FACE, AFLW and FDDB datasets. Based on extra annotations, we propose a mutually beneficial regression target for 3D face reconstruction, that is predicting 3D vertices projected on the image plane constrained by a common 3D topology. The proposed 3D face reconstruction branch can be easily incorporated, without any optimisation difficulty, in parallel with the existing box and 2D landmark regression branches during joint training. Extensive experimental results show that RetinaFace can simultaneously achieve stable face detection, accurate 2D face alignment and robust 3D face reconstruction while being efficient through single-shot inference.},
